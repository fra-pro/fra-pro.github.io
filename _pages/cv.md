Projects
======
* **Ground-to-Aerial image matching for geospatial applications**
  * Thesis project in **Computer Vision**, the work has been done in collaboration with the **ESA-φ-lab** of Frascati, Rome;
  * Developed a **Neural Networks**-based architecture to match a query ground view image with a satellite one representing the same location, using **Python** and **TensorFlow**.
* **Distance estimation of traffic signs in driving environment**
  * Developed an offline **Neural Networks**-based architecture to estimate the distances to the traffic signs from a camera mounted on a car, using **Python** and **TensorFlow**.
* **Covid-19 detection from chest x-ray**
  * Developed a **Neural Networks**-based architecture to detect patients affected by COVID-19 through chest x-ray images, first training and testing three well-known networks and then developing two networks from scratch. The project has been implemented using **Python** and **TensorFlow**;
  * Collected online accessible chest x-ray images to create an ad hoc dataset.
* **Computer vision - paper “fighting fake news: image splice detection via learned self-consistency”**
  * Implemented and tested the mentioned paper **Neural Network**-based architecture with the aim of learning real images metadata, to discriminate them from fake ones.
* **Assembly function recognizer**
  * Implemented a method to recognize assembly functions among 4 classes, using **Python** to exploit two Machine Learning Algorithms, the S**upport Vector Machine** and the **Generative Model**.
* **Rasa NLP - Mall receptionist**
  * Implemented a mall receptionist to assist customers in finding shops, restaurants, and related information, by filters. The project has been implemented with the **SpeechRecognition Python library** combined with the **Rasa Framework** for the Language Understanding part.
* **Reinforcement learning - PPO Algorithm implementation**
  * Developed the Reinforcement Learning **PPO Algorithm** in a simulated environment using **Neural Networks**. It is implemented with **Python** and **PyTorch**.
* **Reliable UDP Protocol**
  * Implemented a reliable version of the **UDP Protocol** to reduce the loss of information in a communication between two endpoints. This project was implemented using **C**.
* **Restaurant database system**
  * Developed a Database System for a pizza restaurant, to track clients' orders, waiters’ work shifts, menu, and the pantry with the quantity of each product. The project has been implemented with **C** and **SQL**.
